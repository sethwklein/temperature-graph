What

When I check the temperature outside, I get a number with no context. What
I need is how cold it is compared to another time I went outside recently.
I probably remember when that was, but I never remember what the temperature
was. A graph fixes that, and this command uses OWM[1] and StatHat[2] to make
that graph.

[1] OWM: http://openweathermap.org/
[2] StatHat: http://www.stathat.com/

Usage

Obviously, sign up with StatHat :)

Go to http://openweathermap.org/wiki/API/JSON_API and figure out how to find
the OWM ID (and maybe name) for the station you're interested in. Future
versions may automate this.

Then run from cron or such something like:

4,14,24,34,44,54 * * * * "$GOPATH"/bin/temperature-graph -email "your@email" -station 1348 -stat weather-KBGR


If you don't run it every 10 minutes, set -interval to match the time between
runs.

Future

Finding a weather station ID requires manual work. I have most of the code to
automate it if you have lat,lon for your location, but don't have it merged
in and hooked up to CLI arguments.

There are actually English speaking people who don't use Fahrenheit (really!)
so Celsius should be supported.

The StatHat library[1] can do verbose reporting but it's a little too verbose
so maybe we need verbosity levels.

The StatHat library reports errors via log.Printf which is unGoish(tm) because
it's inflexible. I should fix it and then update this to match.
