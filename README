What

When I check the temperature outside, I get a number without context. What
I need is how cold it is compared to another time I went outside recently.
I probably remember when that was, but I never remember what the temperature
was. A graph fixes that, and this command uses OWM[1] and StatHat[2] to make
that graph.

go get github.com/sethwklein/temperature-graph

Usage

Obviously, sign up with StatHat :)

For now, find the OWM ID of the station you want by hand like this:
Use something like http://universimmedia.pagesperso-orange.fr/geo/loc.htm
to find your latitude and longitude and put that into something like
http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.1/find/station?lat=43.7&lon=-70.3 .
The first "id" field is the OWM ID of the station you probably want. If that
doesn't work, you may be able to figure something out using information from
http://openweathermap.org/wiki/API/JSON_API

Then run temperature-graph from cron or such with something like:

* * * * * /home/you/gopath/bin/temperature-graph -email "your@email" -station 1363 -stat temperature-KPWM

Where 1363 is your station id, temperature-KPWM is whatever you want to see
on StatHat, and /home/you/gopath is your GOPATH because vixie-cron (and maybe
others) don't set those variables. YMMV.

If you don't want a stat reported unless it's changed, set -interval to match
the time between runs.

If you haven't configured email, on Gentoo errors will end up in ~/dead.letter.

Future

Finding a weather station ID requires manual work. I have most of the code to
automate it if you have lat,lon for your location, but don't have it merged
in and hooked up to CLI arguments.

There are actually English speaking people who don't use Fahrenheit (really!)
so Celsius should be supported.

The StatHat library[1] can do verbose reporting but it's a little too verbose
so maybe we need verbosity levels.

The StatHat library reports errors via log.Printf which is unGoish(tm) because
it's inflexible. I should fix it and then update this to match.
